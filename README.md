<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The goal of this experiment was to model the relationship between weather observations and the prevalence of new influenza infections. It included reading, preparing and transforming data. Subsequently, these data were visualized and used for building a prediction model - we tried to predict influenza infections based on weather conditions.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)

## Getting Started

### JupyterLab

#### Installation
JupyterLab can be installed using `conda` or `pip`. For more detailed instructions, consult the [installation guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

##### conda
If you use conda, you can install it with:

```console
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```
##### pip
If you use pip, you can install it with:

```console
pip install jupyterlab
```

If installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in order to launch `jupyter lab`.
